introduction_p1 = "This report/analysis tries to examine the general progress of the  business data provided. \
    First, it examines the distribution of all categorical features with a maximium of 15 uniques values. \
    Most features that provide qualitative insights about sales data mostly have less than 15 unique features, for example, \
    a gender is most likely to have just two unique values,male and female while features like customers' name is most likely \
    to have more than 15 unique values(name) which might not provide any valuable insight into our data.\
    We calculate each value's percentage of occurance in the data, for example gender might have 50% male and 50% female which shows\
    a balance patronage. Please note that this unique values distributions might not equal purchasing power."

introduction_p2 = "Second, this report examines daily avaerage sales(qty) and monthly total sales(qty) of values product categories,\
    sales groupings, and product names. The number of product types or brands which can be classified under product category \
    can range from one to infinity which might be difficult to visualize, thus  product categories, sales groupings, product names or customers' \
    groupings that has more than six(6) unique features will be splited into multiple graphs. Each graph wheather on average daily sales or \
    monthly total sales will represent information on either six or less than six product types or brand when analyzing a product brand feature \
    that has more than six unique values"

introduction_p3 = "Third, this report presents insights on the average percantage returns (returns(%)) of product categories, eg. product type \
    or product names. Average return percentage tends to show on average, the percantage of profit each brand returns in relation with the amount \
    invested in it. For more details on how return(%) is calculated,please see the feature engineering section in the cleaning report.\
    The unique values might range from one to infinity, thus each graph will represent information on either 16 or less than 16 \
    product types or brands' average percentage returns when analyzing a product brand feature that has more than 16 unique values."

introduction_p4 = "All the graphs in this report can be assessed in the pngs folders, for your personal use. This would make it easy for to \
to prepare your own reports or presentation. This project is still on its early stage, your feedbacks and comments, please go a long way."
